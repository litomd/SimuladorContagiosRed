Versions numbered sequentially.

Positivity:

Versions after http://litomd.com/simred/index0034.html implement a feature for seeking a testing positivity goal. If positivity percentage is below goal then number of tests applied is decreased and increased otherwise. With the same number of cases, positivity increases when number of tests decrements, and it decreases when number of test grows.
